        This is Project Level Documentation.  That means it contains a lot more information about the 
        internal workings (implementation) of the program than would normally be included (ie. Source code).
        <p>
            The purpose of this documentation, is to assist future developers by giving them ready access
            to all of the Javadoc comments, down to the <i>private</i> level.
        <p>
            <b>Project Description:</b><br>
            The project task was to develop an application that uses a nested class that shows countries with 
            cities inside.  These countries were to be stored in a doubly linked list.
